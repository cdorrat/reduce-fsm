# reduce-fsm

## Features
reduce-fsm provides a simple way to specify clojure [finite state machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine), it allows you to:

- Define define state machines that accumulate values (in the same was that reduce does)
- Create lazy sequences from state machines
- Perform stateful filtering with clojures filter/remove functions
- Visualize the resulting state machines with graphviz

All generated state machines are plain clojure functions and read events from clojure sequences.
Events are dispatched with core.match and allow the use of all match features (guards, destructuring, regex matching, etc.)

## Documentation and Source

- This documentation is available at http://cdorrat.github.com/reduce-fsm/
- The API documentation is available on github at http://cdorrat.github.com/reduce-fsm/api

## Usage
The fastest way to use this library is with Leiningen or Cake. Add the following to your project.clj dependencies:

```clojure
[reduce-fsm "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

Use via:

```clojure
(require '[reduce-fsm :as fsm])
```

## Examples

#### Basic FSM 
The following example counts the number of times "ab" occurs in a sequence. 

```clojure
(defn inc-val [val & _] (inc val))

(fsm/defsm count-ab
  [[:start
    \a -> :found-a]
   [:found-a
    \a ->  :found-a
    \b -> {:action inc-val} :start
    _ -> :start]])

;; We can use the generated fsm like any function
(map (partial count-ab 0) ["abaaabc" "aaacb" "bbbcab"])
;; returns => (2 0 1)

(show-fsm count-ab)
;; displays the fsm diagram below

```

### Incremental FSM
The following example repeats the state machine from the Basic FSM example but uses function calls to provide
events instead of clojure sequences. This can be useful when you have multiple event sources or events are
generated by callbacks.

```clojure
(defn inc-val [val & _] (inc val))

(fsm/defsm-inc count-ab
  [[:start
    \a -> :found-a]
   [:found-a
    \a ->  :found-a
    \b -> {:action inc-val} :start
    _ -> :start]])

;; create an instance of the fsm with an initial value of 0
(def fsm-state (atom (count-ab 0)))

;; update the state with a few events
(swap! fsm-state fsm/fsm-event \a)
(swap! fsm-state fsm/fsm-event \a)
(swap! fsm-state fsm/fsm-event \b)

(:value @fsm-state)
;; returns the current accumulated value => 1 

(:state @fsm-state)
;; the current state of the fsm => :start

;; count the number of ab occurences in a string
(:value (reduce fsm/fsm-event (count-ab 0) "abaaabc"))
;; => 2

````

#### Generating Lazy Sequences

The fsm-seq functions return lazy sequences of values created by the emit function when a state change occurs. 
This example looks for log lines where the sequence of events was (a,c) instead of the expected (a,b,c) and
adds the unexpected event to the output sequence. 


```clojure
(defn emit-evt [val evt] evt)

(defsm-seq log-search
  [[:start
    #".*event a" -> :found-a]
   [:found-a
    #".*event b" -> :found-b
    #".*event c" -> {:emit emit-evt} :start]
   [:found-b
    #".*event c" -> :start]])

;; The resulting function accepts a sequence of events 
;; and returns a lazy sequence of emitted values
(take 2 (log-search (cycle ["1 event a"
                            "2 event b"
                            "3 event c"
                            "another event"
                            "4 event a"
                            "event x"
                            "5 event c"])))

;; returns => ("5 event c" "5 event c")

(show-fsm log-search)
;; displays the image below

```

#### Stateful Filtering
States in filters are defined as passing values (default) or suppressing them {:pass false}.
For each event the filter will return the pass value of the state it is in after processing the event (input sequence element).

The following example suppresses values from the time a 3 is encountered until we see a 6.

```clojure
(defsm-filter sample-filter
  [[:initial
    3 -> :suppressing]
   [:suppressing {:pass false}
    6 -> :initial]])

;; The resulting fsm is used with the clojure.core/filter and remove functions like this.
(filter (sample-filter) [1 2 3 4 5 1 2 6 1 2])
;; returns => (1 2 6 1 2)

(show-fsm sample-filter)
;; displays the diagram below
```

#### Other examples

There are additional exmaples on [github](https://github.com/cdorrat/reduce-fsm/tree/master)
in the examples and test directories  including:

- a simple tcp server
- matching repeating groups
- using the :event-and-acc match syntax
- using guards on events
